Please find here the installation instructions for the "Solarmax Watcher"
=========================================================================


1. The smw-logger
=============


Requirements
------------

mysql client library (libmysqlclient-dev)
a running mysql-server

Download the ZIP archiv and extract the file
--------------------------------------------

gunzip < Solarmax-Watcher-MT2.tar.gz | tar xvf -

Compiling Instructions
----------------------

- change into the logger-folder of this archiv
- compile with: 
  gcc -W -Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Wlong-long -Wformat -Wpointer-arith -rdynamic -pedantic-errors -std=c99 -o smw-logger smw-logger.c -lmysqlclient


Running
-------

- run install.sh script to install and configure the complete software by typing

  ./install.sh

or install manually ...

- edit and execute the 'bin/create_db.sh'-script of this archive to create the mysql-db and the
  required tables. If more than one inverter should be logged, you have to repead executing the
  script with diffrent table-names (log1, log2 etc.)
- copy the logger to the prefered path, e. g. /usr/local/bin/
- edit the config-file and copy it to the prefered path, e. g. /usr/local/etc/
- edit init.d-script, copy it into the /etc/init.d/ - folder and make it startable.
- Run with: /etc/init.d/solarmax-logger start

It is recommended to schedule the logger to be started between 5:00 - 6:00 in the morning and
stopped between 22:00 and 23:00 in the evening (compare with sunshine duration). The logger
has no built-in facility for logging, so use CRON or similar. I use the following CRON entries:

    00 05 * * * /etc/init.d/solarmax-logger start
    00 23 * * * /etc/init.d/solarmax-logger stop

If more than one inverter is installed, connect the 1st one with your LAN and set it to ID 001.
The others have to be connected via RS485 in ROW, with ascending ID's (002, 003 ...) and disabled
LAN interface.

If you want to unistall the software either in parts or complete you can run the uninstall script by typing

./Solarmax_uninstaller.sh

with root rights. It guides you through the options of uninstalling.


2. The virtualizer
==================


Requirements
------------

- A running web-server (e. g. apache2) with installed and enabled php and gd (e. g. php5 php5-gd php5-mysql)
- The above mentioned SolarMax logger should work well, without errors


Installation
------------

Copy all files from the "web-folder" of this archive to a new folder of the www-section of your web-server, which is typically '/var/www/' 
or /srv/www/htdocs/'

Change the following settings in the mentioned php-files:
  1. Line 54 in 'solarertrag.php': exchange 'host', 'user' and 'password' against the values that you need to get access to your solarmax database.
  2. '...predictions.php': enter the appropriate values for the location of your photovoltaic system.
  3. You don't like the title image? Ok, make your own, dimensions should be 820 on 120 pixels. Name it 'header.jpg' and put it in the 
     directory 'img/'. Or search for 'header.jpg' in 'solarertrag.css' and change this filename to what you need.
  4. The colors of the graphs are quite ugly? Look at 'colors.php' and enter your favorite HTML color values.
  5. In 'sitehead.php' you can change the title, the subtitle and the associated links of the page.
  6. At least you should change $maxpac in 'drawday.php' to a value which is a little bit higher than the kWp of your photovoltaic system.
  7. The remuneration for my PV system is 0,3405 EUR per kWh. If your milage varies change it in 'solarertrag.php' end of line 297.


Usage
-----

Now you can call 'solarertrag.php' in your browser and look forward for the money coming in :-)

The php script examines the preferred language of the used browser and shows the pages text automatically in this language if there's a 
translation for it. If no translation is available, the english version is shown.

If you want to monitor more than one inverter you have to name your databases tables with numbers after 'log', e.g. 'log1', 'log2' etc. (see above). 
Add links for the inverters in 'sitehead.php' like 
  
  http://yourwebadress/solarertrag.php?wr=x

where x is the number of the inverter. Call the page with: http://yourwebadress/solarertrag.php?wr=x
